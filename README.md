# fib_email

This is the beginnings of what I hope to be a nural net email managment tool

The idea will be to index a mailbox and then watch changes to learn how a user

interacts with there mailbox and take over tasks as in filing email's etc.

To Run you will need the following:
* Python3.6 or greater
* GmailAPI - I used this https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python
* Pandas
* sqlalchemy


Right now it will only dump all emails in an mailbox into an sqlite3 DB.
